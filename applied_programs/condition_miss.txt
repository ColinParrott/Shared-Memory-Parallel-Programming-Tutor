--Name--
Condition miss

-- Description --
There are three threads. One thread awaits for some condition to become true, and when it becomes true it updates
some variable to reflect that.

-- High Level Example ---
a = 5;


# some code
...
a = 25;
condition = 1;
//
<await (condition == 1); variable_to_update=a;>
//
# some code
...
condition = 0;

-- Important part --
Even if condition is set to 1, the await might never execute if the condition is set to zero by the third thread
is executed before the await.

-- High Level Code --

a = 25;
condition = 1;
//
<await (condition == 1) x=a;>
//
condition = 0;
