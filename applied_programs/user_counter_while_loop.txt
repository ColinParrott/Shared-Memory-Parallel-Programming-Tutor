--Name--
User counter (2 connects)


-- Description --
Part of a program which handles users connecting/disconnecting and tracks the number of users to ensure that no
more than 100 users can connect. We currently have 99 users and a disconnect and 2 connects happen at *roughly* the same time.


-- High Level Example ---

user_count = 99
i = 0
...
# simulates 2 users connecting
while(i < 2){
if(user_count < 100){
    # handle new connection
    ...
    user_count++;
}
<i++;>
}
//
...
# user disconnects
user_count--;



-- Important part --
It's possible for the user_count to not be at the expected 100 limit - can allow 101 users


-- High Level Code --
(u=99,i=0)

while(i<2){
if(u < 100){
u++;
}
<i++;>
}
//
u--;
