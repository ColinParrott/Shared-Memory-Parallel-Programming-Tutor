--Name--
Jobs done counter


-- Description --
Imagine two threads doing some work and the final threads does something with each of their results.
To signify if a thread has done its work, it updates the job_done counter atomically - however one thread's code
erroneously didn't make the update atomic.

-- High Level Example ---

# do some work
a = 5;
jobs_done++; # forgot to make atomic
//
# do some work
b=7;
<jobs_done++;>
//
<AWAIT jobs_done==2;>
c=a+b;


-- Important part --
It's possible for await to never execute if the non_atomic job_done loads 0, then atomic update in thread 2 happens,
thread 1 finish it's increment but leaves jobs_done at 1.


-- High Level Code --
(j=0);

a = 5;
j=j+1;
//
b=7;
<j=j+1;>
//
<AWAIT j==2;>
c=a+b;
