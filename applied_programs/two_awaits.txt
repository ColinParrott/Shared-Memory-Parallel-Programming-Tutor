--Name--
Two await conditions

-- Description --
Two threads are waiting on a condition that should only activate one of the threads,
intuitively the i==2 thread first.

-- High Level Example ---
(i,a = 0 initially)

<await (i==3;) x=2; i=4;>
# do stuff
//
<await (i==2;) x=1; i=4;>
# do stuff
//
while(i<3){
i++;
}

-- Important part --
The condition should activate the i==2 thread first however it's possible it's missed and thread i==3 goes.
It's also possible both are activated.

-- High Level Code --
Same as above basically.


-- Assembly Code--
 # compiler
