--Name--
User counter


-- Description --
Part of a program which handles users connecting/disconnecting and tracks the number of users to ensure that no
more than 100 users can connect. We currently have 99 users and a disconnect and connect happen at the same time.


-- High Level Example ---

user_count = 99
...
# user connects
if(user_count < 100){
    # handle new connection
    ...
    user_count++;
}
//
...
# user disconnects
user_count--;



-- Important part --
It's possible for the user_count to not be the expected 99 after a connect and disconnect - could be 98/100.


-- High Level Code --
(u=99)

if(u < 100){
u++;
}
//
u--;
