--Name--
Trivial condition

-- Description --
Condition that in theory should ALWAYS be true, can actually evaluate to false.

-- High Level Example ---
(i,a = 0 initially)

i = 5;
//
if(i==i){
a = 1;
}

-- Important part --
The condition check will involve two loads, so it's possible for it check if 0==5, if thread 1 stores 5 into
i between the two loads

-- High Level Code --
Same as above basically.


-- Assembly Code--
 # compiler
