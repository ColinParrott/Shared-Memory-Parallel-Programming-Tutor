1) When loading a program via the button with only one thread, there's an error (but is fixed if a program with more than one thread is loaded first)
2) Enable scrolling on code list, currently not scrollable despite bar being there (make it autoscroll too)
3) Allow AWAIT to support two conditions (currently just one) - maybe support the IDENTIFIER OP INT_LITERAL version (would need to fix instruction parser to support varying types for a single token)
4) Added help dialog to compiler window (add program window)

[✓] 4) Figure out how to get errors from lexer/parser and stop lexing/parsing before it hits an exception
[✓] 5) Add whole program (multiple threads) lexer & parser
